# Hamming-Encoder

The folling link was used for calculations: http://users.cis.fiu.edu/~downeyt/cop3402/hamming.html

This weblink provides a very good explanation on how to calculate the hamming code and thus from this we can aso find out our own way to decode this.

Microsoft visual studio is recommended to run this program.
